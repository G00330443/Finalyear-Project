\section{Idea Raised}
\\
This is a Node.js Project that for Final year project named Second-Hand shopping website, this idea is emerging from myself experience that when I first time come to Ireland I can't adapter to different eating habits and culture. I'm extremely want to cook Chinese food, but many Chinese cookers (some Chinese student took it from home when they come to foreign country) I can't buy in here. So, I raised an idea that if I can buy those second-hand cooker from shopping website must good, and when I leave this country I can sale most living product to other people who need it.\\ 
On the other hand, thinking this from Market side. Impulse buying (Research of Impulse Buying \cite{4}) is a very common it happened around our life.I believe every have some similar experience when you bought some products and arrive home fell this is not really useful in home. But you don't want throw it then store it. This kind of behaviour caused great waste, so my website also can give them a place to dispose some useless product and get a suitable return.\\
Thirdly, it very hard when young people just start them first job and move out family live with themselves, many living product need to buy such as sofa, ice-fridge, table, or TV. Some people don't have enough money to buy new items, my website will become a place help them use litter money to get those furniture. 
WWW From birth to present, Impact on people's lives at an alarming rate , Revolution in e-commerce on the Internet came into being. Online shopping system is through Web Online purchase system, This paper studies based on Node.js Design technology of online shopping system.\\

According Data and trend, Stacey Rudolph \cite{3} was written an article named The Future of Online Shopping is Bright--Statistics and trends. The main content in article is Retail worldwide onlone retail spending is expected to grow rapidly over the next few years. There have a picture below see figure \ref{fig:1 cubed graph}:

\subsection{Biggest part of consuming}  
Paco Underhill \cite{14} the author of a book named Why we Buy said “Two-thirds of the shopping that goes in in malls is impulse buying “and  “Actually two-thirds of the economy is impulse buying”
Many people fall victim to the last-minute impulse purchase. In fact, 90 percent of shoppers buy items not on their shopping list. 
Therefore, we can see online shopping already become a modern people’s lifestyle, and I’s firmly believe Second-hand Shopping website will have a good future, because It not only match most people’s shopping habit but also can help them to dispose some useless furniture and get corresponding returns.

\section{The important thing of Online Shopping is Security} 
In before, people start choose use online shopping the most important thing for them is time, there have a successful business man said: "when I was younger was traded time for money, now I trade money for time. The reason that I like to shop online, because it saves time." Many people said the most attractive thing let them shopping online is not the price in fact, but save time, delivery is the main reason let they choose to shopping online.\\
However, nowadays customers need to pay more attention on security when they are shopping because we are living in a technically advanced world and it leaves us vulnerable any time we are go online. Abe Garvet have a article to describe some risks when you shopping online.\cite{15}\\
Fake On-line Reviews\\
A collection of five-star ratings can do amazing things for on-line sellers. As a result, some authors have confessed to posting fake reviews; So customers will easily be taken in those fake information.\\
\\
\subsection{Lack Of Full Cost Disclosure }
Additional fee such as delivery fee, maybe hidden until you complete check out part. For example: when you onlin shopping and compare price between different shops, finally you find a prefect one have low-price and free delivery. But when you check out there have a line of small words said you need to make membership (\$ 45 )to get free delivery, you did this. This meant the actual cost was 20\% greater than I was lead to believe. Don't expect software to come with the computer.
\\
\subsection{Quality is not guaranteed}
As is known to all, the quality is the consumer to purchase goods and services, the focus of the core factors and at present a lot of online consumers actually received goods are not in the eyes of goods, product quality is also often appear problem, it makes the security and reliability of network people on online shopping
\\
\subsection{Personal information leakage}
There have some companies do not have completely security to protect consumers account detail, it let many hackers can get them information easily.\\ 
For example:  if someone steals your debit card number, your entire checking account is exposed. Within minutes, identity thieves can drain your account and set you back financially for years \\
Finally it will let consumer get lost in economy.

\section{Design ideas}
Online shopping system makes full use of Brower/Server structure characteristics of implementation system ported to Internet functions, has the advantage of great convenience to the users of the system, reduces the regional restrictions and may not be shopping phenomenon.\\
And point the most important part of online shopping website design is security. So in second-hand shopping website I will pay more attention on security system design.\\
